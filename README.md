# Shakespeare
Using NLP techniques to analyze and describe the works of Shakespeare

# Can we analyze beauty?
Despite the fact that the works of Shakespeare are 450+ years old, they remain timeless. We owe much of the English language to him. Countless theses and dissertations have focused their energies on one work or another. We analyze his plays and poetry all the time, often in wonder how one person could be so prolific in creativity, producing so much depth of beauty with words. So the question is whether we can mathematically, with machine learning, gain a deeper understanding of this great playwright and poet.
